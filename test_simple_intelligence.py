⚡ WEEK'S MAJOR DEVELOPMENT
{sample_events[0]['headline']}

📊 MARKET IMPACT
• Copper market disruption with 18% price plunge
• Canadian mining sector positioned for domestic benefits

💰 COMMODITY SCORECARD
📉 Copper: Major event-driven volatility
📈 Gold: Safe-haven demand amid trade tensions
➡️ Silver: Stable amid copper market chaos

📈 CANADIAN MINING REACTION
• First Quantum, Lundin Mining lead sector gains
• Domestic copper producers see opportunity in tariff policy
• TSX mining index shows mixed reaction to global trade developments

🔍 ANALYSIS: Trump's copper tariff represents major shift in U.S. trade policy with direct implications for Canadian mining sector. While global copper prices initially plunged on demand concerns, Canadian producers may benefit from reduced foreign competition and potential domestic premium pricing.

💡 WEEK'S TAKEAWAY: Policy-driven market disruption highlights importance of North American mining supply chains and positions Canadian copper producers advantageously in evolving trade landscape.
